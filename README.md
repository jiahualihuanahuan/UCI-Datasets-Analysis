1 Diabetes
Diabetes patient records were obtained from two sources: an automatic electronic recording device and paper records. The automatic device had an internal clock to timestamp events, whereas the paper records only provided "logical time" slots (breakfast, lunch, dinner, bedtime). For paper records, fixed times were assigned to breakfast (08:00), lunch (12:00), dinner (18:00), and bedtime (22:00). Thus paper records have fictitious uniform recording times whereas electronic records have more realistic time stamps.
